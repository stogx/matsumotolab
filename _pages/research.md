# Research

# “On-skin-pancreas” technology for precision medicine in diabetes
When boronic acid, which binds reversibly to glucose, is introduced into an appropriate polymer gel network, a reversible hydration change is induced associated with dissociation equilibrium shifts of the boronic acid in response to glucose. In synchronization with this, a thin dehydrated and the gel-surface-localized layer called "skin layer" provides a control for insulin release in response to blood glucose levels. Research is underway for the practical application of such totally synthetic "on-skin artificial pancreas" that does not use any machinery or proteins.

# Boronic acids-based molecular-recognition chemistry as a platform for diagnostic and therapeutic applications
Sialic acid (Neu5Ac) is abundant at the carbohydrate ends of cells, and its dynamics are associated with cellular phenomena such as development, differentiation, and disease. In particular, it is universally overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. Since sialic acid is also present in normal tissues, a tumor environment-specific activation mechanism is required for safe drug targeting. We aim to tackle this problem with boronic acid. Furthermore, we extend our research to cancer stem cell targeted therapy, cancer immunotherapy, boron neutron capture therapy, and extracellular vehicles capture and diagnostic device technology integrated with electronics.

# Development of protected boronic acids for stimulus-cleavable chemistry and its biomedical applications
Boronic acids are small molecules that interact with a wide variety of biomolecules, and their binding strength and selectivity are variable in synthetic chemistry. In this theme, we are developing a new cleavage reaction system with reversible molecular recognition capability in water taking advantage of the boronic acid-based protection chemistry. This basic research aims to develop a new class of stimulus-cleavable chemistry platform for a variety of biomedical applications including protein conjugation, design of prodrugs, drug delivery systems as well as self-healing materials. 

# Next-era microneedle technology for easy and reliable multidrug administration at home
A great unmet need exists for the process by which anyone can take prescribed medications accurately, conveniently, and without pain. We will develop a new transdermal drug delivery system that overcomes the challenges of medication administration to provide safe and secure home healthcare. This technology will not only improve the quality of life of patients, but will also help healthcare professionals.

**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren.

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
