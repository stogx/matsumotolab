- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"
  image: Pairs3.png
  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.
